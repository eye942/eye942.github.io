I am a computational linguistics major at USC.

How technologies and language mesh fascinates me.

#####  Major interests:
1. speech generation
2. recognition
3. natural language understanding.
4. technological imitation and alternatives to human cognition


##### Personal Interests:
1. Programming Languages
    * Especially functional languages like Haskell and Lisp
    * I want to try my hand at type theory eventually.
2. Quantum Computing
    * Interesting to see what comes out from this technology
3. Cybersecurity
    * The human and physical vulnerabilities to software security is interesting
4. Math
    * I would have been a mathematician if I had a better intuition.
